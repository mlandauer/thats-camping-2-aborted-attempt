h1. That's Camping!

h2. "Its raining and my weetbix is wet. _That's Campin!"_

The app's namesake is a yearly event when an extended group of friends leave the city lights of Sydney behind to get together, go camping and see in the new year surrounded by good friends, good food and the delights of the Australian bush.

h2. Tech stuff

This web app uses Twitter Boostrap 2 and Ember.js to make an app that works even when you don't have a network connection. This, of course, is most of the time when you're off camping somewhere.

To get a local development version running:

git clone git@github.com:mlandauer/thats-camping-2.git
cd thats-camping-2
bundle install
rails s

Now point your browser at http://localhost:3000

And that should be all there is to it!
